# firewalld-openvpn-killswitch
killswitch-v.2: simple scripts that help print instructions and all unique IPs in a .ovpn file.
toggle-killswitch: on/off/status to help move a configured interface to the firewalld VPN-ONLY zone.

This was all inspired by this fantastic guide: https://meow464.neocities.org/blog/firewalld-vpn-killswitch/
